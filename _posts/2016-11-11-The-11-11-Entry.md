After god knows how many tries, i have finally found a easy way to host my own blog yet with flexibility of the control flow. Maybe i am just bad at looking out for other awesome frameworks that people have done resulting in such a long search :'( But all in all, I'm still happy i found Jekyll.

So its 11th November 2016, supposedly the 'Singles Day', and im at home fixing up my blog. Sounds like i really have nobody to go out with, and that is the reason i have time to put things together. -(^w^")-
